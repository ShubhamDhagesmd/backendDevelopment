# Assignment Round

This repository contains solutions to the JavaScript and Node.js with TypeScript assignments.

## JavaScript Assignment

### Task 1: Array Manipulation

Implement a JavaScript function to filter unique elements from an array of integers without using built-in functions like Set.

### Task 2: Object Operations

Create and merge properties from two car objects into a new object.

### Task 3: Logical Operations

Develop a function that identifies common elements between two arrays of integers without using built-in functions.

## Node.js and TypeScript Assignment

### Task 4: RESTful API Development

Design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js and TypeScript with the following endpoints:
- `GET /api/products`: Retrieve a list of products.
- `GET /api/products/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific product by ID.
- `POST /api/products`: Create a new product.
- `PUT /api/products/:id`: Update details of a specific product by ID.
- `DELETE /api/products/:id`: Delete a product by ID.
Use an in-memory data store (e.g., an array) for storing product data.

### Task 5: Middleware Implementation

Create middleware to log timestamp, HTTP method, and requested URL for incoming API requests.

### Task 6: Unit Testing

Write unit tests for at least two API endpoints using a testing framework (e.g., Jest) covering various scenarios including success cases and error handling.

### Task 7: Documentation

Provide comprehensive API documentation including instructions to run the server locally, available endpoints, and example requests and responses.
