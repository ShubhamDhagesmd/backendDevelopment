# Task 1: Array Manipulation

This task involves writing a JavaScript function that processes an array of integers and returns a new array containing only the unique elements from the original array, without using any built-in functions like Set.

## Function Description

### `getUniqueElements(arr)`

This function takes an array `arr` of integers as input and returns a new array containing only the unique elements found in the original array.

#### Parameters

- `arr`: An array of integers.

#### Return Value

- A new array containing only the unique elements from the input array.

## Implementation Approach

Implement the function `getUniqueElements` using a custom algorithm to identify and extract unique elements from the input array. Utilize control structures (loops, conditional statements) to achieve this without relying on built-in JavaScript functions like Set.

## Execution of code
    you can run this code by command 'node arrayManipulation.js'.

# Task 2: Object Operations

This task involves creating a JavaScript object representing a car with properties such as brand, model, and year. Additionally, you're required to write a function that merges two car objects into a new object while preserving properties from both.

## Object Structure

The car object structure should include the following properties:

- `brand`: String representing the brand of the car.
- `model`: String representing the model of the car.
- `year`: Number representing the manufacturing year of the car.

## Function Description

### `mergeCarObjects(car1, car2)`

This function takes two car objects `car1` and `car2` as input and returns a new object containing properties from both input objects.

#### Parameters

- `car1`: First car object.
- `car2`: Second car object.

#### Return Value

- A new object containing properties merged from both input car objects.

## Implementation Approach

Create the car object structure and write the `mergeCarObjects` function to combine properties from `car1` and `car2` into a new object. Ensure that the function retains properties from both input objects.

## Execution of code.
    You can run this code by command 'node objectOperation.js' in terminal.

# Task 3: Logical Operations

For this task, you'll be implementing a function that operates on two arrays of integers and returns a new array containing common elements between them, without using any built-in functions for this purpose.

## Function Description

### `getCommonElements(arr1, arr2)`

This function takes two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` of integers as input and returns a new array containing only the common elements found in both input arrays.

#### Parameters

- `arr1`: First array of integers.
- `arr2`: Second array of integers.

#### Return Value

- A new array containing only the common elements found in both input arrays.

## Implementation Approach

Implement the `getCommonElements` function using a custom algorithm to identify and extract common elements between `arr1` and `arr2`. Use loops, conditional statements, or any logical operations to achieve this without using built-in JavaScript functions.


## Execution of code
    You can run this code by 'node logicalOperation.js'
